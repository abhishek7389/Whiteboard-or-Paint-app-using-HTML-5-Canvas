# Whiteboard-or-Paint-app-using-HTML-5-Canvas

There are lots of languages available to make a whiteboard, but I think using HTML5 Canvas, 
This is very easy to make it. there are lots of inbuilt eventListeners, functions are available, 
which makes very easy to implement your vision and very handy. 



Some of the features of my whiteboard:

Pencil button : to start drawing using pencil use this button.

Eraser button : With this you can erase your mistakes. Be sure after using the eraser you have to click one more time the eraser button to change its value then use the other button.
Clear button : If you want to clear your entire canvas you can do with the help of this.

Save button : This is used  to save your sketch in your local machine.

Rectangle button : This button is used to make rectangle shapes.

Color choose options : you can choose any of the color using color picker button for pencil as well as rectangle shape.
Range button : With the help of this you can select the size of your brush.


I’m not that much good in CSS so there is some styling issues and this is my ongoing project so there are lots of more features I’m going to add and fix some issues so 
Enjoy your Canvas.
